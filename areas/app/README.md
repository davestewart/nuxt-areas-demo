# Areas "App" folder

This is a special folder which lets you clean up your project root.

If you move your `layouts`, `pages`, and `store` folders here, Areas will automatically reconfigure Nuxt's `dir` configuration [option](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-dir) to treat these folders as the master folders.
